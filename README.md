# Maxwells Equations
This repository contains the `LaTeX` code for a document that
lists Maxwell's equations of electromagnetism
without and with magnetic charge.

##Generating the document
Assuming you have `pdflatex` installed on your machine
(as well as the necessary `LaTeX` packages),
simply clone the repository and run the `process.sh`
script:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/twhyntie/maxwells_equations.git
$ cd maxwells_equations
$ . process.sh
```
